# Service Worker
Service Workers are a technology that allows your web application to use cached resources first and provide a default 
experience offline before getting more data from the network later. This principle is commonly known as Offline First.

#### Key Features of Service Workers

1. **Offline First:**
    - Service Workers enable web applications to load resources from cache first, providing an offline experience before 
      attempting to fetch data from the network.
2. **Promise-Based:**
    - Service Workers actively use promises, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations.

3. **Lifecycle:**
    - Service Workers have a lifecycle that includes installation, activation, and then they can react to fetch, push, 
      and sync events.

#### Service Worker Lifecycle

1. **Installation:**
    - The Service Worker is installed in the browser.

2. **Activation:**
    - Once installed, the Service Worker is activated and can start controlling web pages.

3. **Events:**
    - After activation, the Service Worker can handle events such as `fetch` (network requests), `push` (notifications), 
      and `sync` (background synchronization).

#### Example Use Case

Service Workers can be used to:
- Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files).
- Provide offline support for web applications.
- Improve performance by serving cached content.
- Handle background tasks like push notifications and background sync.
