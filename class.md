# Class 
In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript introduced a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance called classes. This class syntax provides a cleaner and more intuitive way to create and manage objects compared to the traditional prototype-based inheritance.

### Key Points
* **Syntactic Sugar:** ES6 classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing prototype-based inheritance. They provide a more straightforward and clearer syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance.
* **Class Declaration:** 
  * Classes are declared using the `class` keyword followed by the class name.
  * The `constructor` method is used for creating and initializing an object created with a class.


#### Prototype-Based Inheritance with Function Expressions
Before ES6, inheritance and object creation were typically done using constructor functions and the prototype chain:
```js
function Bike(model, color) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
  return this.model + " bike has " + this.color + " color";
};

const bike1 = new Bike('Yamaha', 'red');
console.log(bike1.getDetails()); // Outputs: Yamaha bike has red color
```  

#### Example of ES6 Classes
The same functionality can be achieved using ES6 classes in a more concise and readable way:
```js
class Bike {
  constructor(model, color) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
  }

  getDetails() {
    return `${this.model} bike has ${this.color} color`;
  }
}

const bike1 = new Bike('Yamaha', 'red');
console.log(bike1.getDetails()); // Outputs: Yamaha bike has red color
```

### Features of ES6 Classes
* **Class Inheritance:** ES6 classes support inheritance using the `extends` keyword, allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
    ```js
    class Vehicle {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    getType() {
        return this.type;
    }
    }

    class Bike extends Vehicle {
    constructor(model, color) {
        super('Bike');
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    getDetails() {
        return `${this.model} bike has ${this.color} color and is a ${this.type}`;
    }
    }

    const bike1 = new Bike('Yamaha', 'red');
    console.log(bike1.getDetails()); // Outputs: Yamaha bike has red color and is a Bike
    ```

* **Static Methods:** Static methods are defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They are called on the class, not on the objects created from the class.
    ```js
    class MathUtilities {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    }

    console.log(MathUtilities.add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
    ```

* **Getters and Setters:** Getters and setters allow you to define methods that are called when a property is accessed or modified.
    ```js
    class Bike {
    constructor(model, color) {
        this._model = model;
        this._color = color;
    }

    get model() {
        return this._model;
    }

    set model(newModel) {
        this._model = newModel;
    }

    getDetails() {
        return `${this._model} bike has ${this._color} color`;
    }
    }

    const bike1 = new Bike('Yamaha', 'red');
    console.log(bike1.getDetails()); // Outputs: Yamaha bike has red color
    bike1.model = 'Honda';
    console.log(bike1.getDetails()); // Outputs: Honda bike has red color
    ```
