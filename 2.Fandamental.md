Lecture 04 - Programming Fundamentals using JavaScript
In the last class, we discussed the fundamental concepts of programming languages. Today, we will learn about the origins of these concepts. Understanding their origins will help us not worry about these basics. The fundamental concepts of programming languages include:

Variables
Operators
Conditions
Loops
Arrays
Objects
Functions
Expression vs. Statement
Variables
We know that a variable is a placeholder. Beginners often struggle with when and where to use variables. Before diving into that, we need to understand the purpose of a variable. In simple terms, variables help us make things dynamic. That's their only job. Variables act like containers. The more containers we have, the more space (memory) we need. So, why do we need extra memory? Can't we just use fewer variables to make our applications lighter? Despite that, we still need to use variables. For example, think about how we get water at home. It starts from underground, gets pumped into a storage tank below the house, and then gets pumped to a tank on the roof before being distributed through pipes to each tap. We store water in filters before finally pouring it into glasses or bottles for drinking. The purpose is to drink water, but we need intermediate storage for distribution and purification. Similarly, variables store data. Without variables, we couldn't reuse data.

js
Copy code
console.log('Abu Rayhan', 'Abu Rayhan'.length); // Abu Rayhan 10
In the example above, if we wanted to change the name, we couldn't do it without removing the current name. In static code, nothing can be changed at runtime. This brings up the question of what runtime and compile time are.

js
Copy code
console.log('Abu Rayhan', 'Abu Rayhan'.length); // Abu Rayhan 10
throw new Error('Something wrong'); // Error
Here, the program has no errors, but a runtime error occurs. Runtime errors happen when a program runs into an issue during execution.

js
Copy code
console.log('Abu Rayhan', 'Abu Rayhan'.length);
121354644dsfsdf
In this case, the first code won't execute, showing an error immediately because the code has a compile-time error.

At runtime, we can dynamically change many things, like input, data from the internet, or mouse clicks. Static data cannot be changed within the log statement in the first example. That's why we need variables to hold data.

js
Copy code
let name = 'Abu Rayhan';
console.log(name, name.length); // Abu Rayhan 10
Using variables has advantages. First, we use the data for "Abu Rayhan." If we want to use it for "Jahid Hasan" or "H M Nayeem," we only need to change the data inside name. Another advantage is that name could be used in many places. If it were used in 2000 or 200,000 places, changing data everywhere manually is impossible. Using variables, we only need to change it in one place.

Let's look at an example to understand how to dynamically change data at runtime using variables.

js
Copy code
const names = [
  'HM Nayeem',
  'Aditya Chakraborty',
  'Abu Rayhan',
  'Shaker Hossain',
  'Akib Ahmad',
  'Alvi Chowdhury',
];
let index = -1;
let person = names[++index];

setInterval(() => {
  person = names[index++];
  console.log(person, person.length);

  if (index === names.length) {
    index = 0;
  }
}, 1000);
Running this program, you'll see the names change every second, cycling back to the first name after reaching the end. Without variables, we couldn't dynamically change data. The purpose of programming is to make everything dynamic, so wherever we see data, we should use variables, even if it means extra memory usage.

Next, let's discuss two important terms, let and const. When to use let and when to use const? If the data doesn't need to be updated, use const. This way, we can't accidentally or intentionally change the data. For data that might be updated later, use let. In the example above, names doesn't change, so we use const. However, index and person are updated, so we use let. The rule is to assume everything as const initially, and if any data is updated later, change it to let. This minimizes mistakes.

In summary, variables are used to dynamically update data at runtime.

Operators
We are all familiar with operators from a young age, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Programming operators are the same. Operators in programming languages are used for mathematical calculations. Nothing more. Operators are essentially functions. In languages that support operator overloading, we create functions to perform operations. For example:

js
Copy code
add();
mod();
lessThan();
We could create an add function for addition, mod for modulus, and lessThan to check if a value is smaller. However, JavaScript doesn't support operator overloading, so we don't need to create these functions. JavaScript provides symbolic representations for these functions, making our work easier. Instead of add(), we use +, instead of mod(), we use %, and instead of lessThan, we use <. There's not much more to say about operators.

Conditions
Conditions are known as the brain of the computer. Based on conditions, the computer decides what action to take. Although computers can't make decisions, we write logic to guide them. We use conditions in our daily lives constantly. For example, if the sky is cloudy, we take an umbrella; otherwise, we don't. This is a condition. If my office starts at 9 AM, I'll take the bus if I leave home by 8 AM; otherwise, I'll take a taxi. This is another condition. In programming, we translate these conditions into code.

js
Copy code
if (studyBasic) {
  wontJoin();
}

if (studyAdvanced) {
  join();
}

if (teacherSpeaks) {
  silent();
}

if (!teacherSpeaks) {
  shout();
}
Here, we use conditions to decide whether to join a class, be silent, or shout. Conditions are essential in programming, as 50% of programming involves conditions and the other 50% involves loops.

There are three scenarios for writing conditions. Let's look at the code below and then explain it.

js
Copy code
// Scenario 1 - Single branch
// if condition
if (hasMoney) {
  buyPhone();
}

// Scenario 2 - Two branches
// if else condition
if (toss === 'head') {
  win();
} else {
  loss();
}

// Scenario 3 - Multiple branches
// else if
let a = 1,
  b = 2;
if (a > b) {
  big();
} else if (a < b) {
  small();
} else {
  same();
}
Scenario 1: Single branch. Here, only one case is possible. We use the if condition for such scenarios. For example, if I have money, I'll buy a phone; otherwise, nothing happens. Only one case is needed here, so we use the if condition.

Scenario 2: Two branches. This involves a maximum of two outcomes. We use the if else condition for such scenarios. For example, if the coin toss is heads, I win; otherwise, I lose. There can't be more than two outcomes here.

Scenario 3: Multiple branches. If more than two outcomes are possible, we use the else if condition. For example, if a > b, a is greater than b. If a < b, a is smaller than b. Otherwise, they are equal. Here, we have more than two outcomes, so we use multiple branches.

Conditions depend on the possible outcomes. Write conditions based on the number of outcomes.

Loop
Loops have one job: to repeat the same task multiple times. For example, a client asks us to print "We love Bangladesh" 51 times in our application because Bangladesh has entered its 51st year. We smartly write console.log('We love Bangladesh') 51 times and show it to the client. The client then asks for 1971 repetitions to commemorate the independence year. We spend three days writing the same code 1971 times. The client now asks for 300,000 repetitions to honor the 3 million martyrs. We're exhausted. After researching, we find a repeat() function in JavaScript. We proudly show the client the code in just 10 minutes.

js
Copy code
console.log('We love Bangladesh\n'.repeat(3000000));
We're thrilled. But the client points out that users won't know if it printed 3 million times and suggests adding a number before each repetition. Now, we need to do this dynamically. Fortunately, loops simplify repetitive tasks.

js
Copy code
for (let i = 1; i <= 3000000; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'We love Bangladesh');
}
The problem is solved. Loops make repetition easy. The block inside curly braces in a loop is like a new JS file where we can write any valid JS code. Remember, the code inside this block will execute multiple times.

There are three main types of loops in JavaScript. Additional loops exist for convenience, but any problem can be solved using one of these loops.

For loop
Range
For in
For of
While loop
Do while loop
For Loop
The for loop can handle tasks of while and do while loops. The for loop is used when we know the starting and ending points. In our example, the client specifies 300,000 repetitions, so we use a for loop. There are three types of for loops: range, for in, and for of. We'll see the other two later.

While Loop
The while loop handles tasks of for and do while loops. It's used when we don't know the range but have a condition. For example, the client wants random numbers with "We love Bangladesh" printed until the number 71 appears.

js
Copy code
while (true) {
  let num = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100);
  console.log(num, 'We love Bangladesh');
  if (num === 71) break;
}
The while loop only has a condition part, unlike the for loop with three parts (initialize, condition, increment/decrement). Use a while loop when you only have a condition.

Do While Loop
The do while loop ensures the block executes at least once, even if the condition is false. It's used when the block needs to run at least once regardless of the condition.

js
Copy code
do {
  console.log('It will run at least once');
} while (false);
Despite the condition being false, it prints once. This is the concept of the do while loop.

Array
Arrays are among the most powerful and underrated data structures. Arrays can be used to create complex data structures like graphs, heaps, stacks, and queues. For handling large amounts of data, arrays are perfect. Why do we need arrays, and what do they do? Suppose we want to store a few names. We could use variables.

js
Copy code
const name1 = 'Rayhan';
const name2 = 'Alvi';
const name3 = 'Anik';
const name4 = 'Arjun';
const name5 = 'Ayman';
To convert these names to lowercase, we need to do it for each variable.

js
Copy code
console.log(name1, name1.toLowerCase());
console.log(name2, name2.toLowerCase());
console.log(name3, name3.toLowerCase());
console.log(name4, name4.toLowerCase());
console.log(name5, name5.toLowerCase());
This becomes unmanageable with thousands of names. We need a way to store all names in one variable. Let's try that.

js
Copy code
const persons = 'Rayhan, Alvi, Anik, Arjun, Ayman';
But this creates a single large string. Let's store them separately.

js
Copy code
const persons = 'Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman';
This causes an error. Arrays solve this problem by using square brackets [].

js
Copy code
const persons = ['Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman'];
We can access data using indices. Indexes start from 0. Let's see how to access data from an array.

js
Copy code
const persons = ['Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman'];
console.log(persons[0]);
console.log(persons[1]);
console.log(persons[2]);
console.log(persons[3]);
console.log(persons[4]);
This is repetitive, so we use a loop.

js
Copy code
const persons = ['Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman'];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(persons[i]);
}
This works, but if we add more names:

js
Copy code
const persons = ['Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman', 'Ayuub', 'Bidyut'];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(persons[i]);
}
The loop stops at Ayman because we set the range to 5. To dynamically handle length, use persons.length. Let's see the first example using arrays and loops.

js
Copy code
const persons = ['Rayhan', 'Alvi', 'Anik', 'Arjun', 'Ayman', 'Ayuub', 'Bidyut'];

for (let i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
  console.log(students[i], students[i].toLowerCase());
}
Arrays are powerful and work well with loops. Arrays can store various data types, unlike some languages that restrict arrays to one data type. In JavaScript, you can store different data types in an array.

js
Copy code
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const bools = [true, true, false, false];
const nulls = [null, null, null];
const undefineds = [undefined, undefined, undefined];
const arrayOfArray = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
const mixed = [true, null, 'Str', 5, [12, 2, 4]];
You can also store objects and functions in arrays, but we haven't covered those yet. Even though JavaScript allows mixed data types, it's best to store similar types for readability and ease of access.

Arrays have functionalities for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Arrays can act like an in-memory database.

Object
If we want to store additional information (email, age, attendance) for students, arrays aren't sufficient. Let's see the problem with arrays.

js
Copy code
const student = ['Abu', 'Rayhan', 'rayhan@example.com', 25, true];
sendEMail(students[0]);

function sendEmail(email) {
  console.log('Sending Email to ', email);
}
The code lacks readability and requires remembering indices for specific information. This is unmanageable with more data. Let's rewrite using an object.

js
Copy code
const student = {
  firstName: 'Abu',
  secondName: 'Rayhan',
  email: 'rayhan@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
};

sendEMail(students.email);

function sendEmail(email) {
  console.log('Sending Email to ', email);
}
This is more readable and informative. Objects allow us to store structured data. We can store multiple students' information in an array of objects.

js
Copy code
const student1 = {
  firstName: 'Abu',
  secondName: 'Rayhan',
  email: 'rayhan@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
};

const student2 = {
  firstName: 'Alvi',
  secondName: 'Chowdhury',
  email: 'alvi@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
};

const student3 = {
  firstName: 'Akib',
  secondName: 'Ahmad',
  email: 'akib@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
};

const allStudents = [student1, student2, student3];

for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
  sendEmail(allStudents[i].email);
}

function sendEmail(email) {
  console.log('Sending email to', email);
}
We create separate objects for each student and store them in an array. To send emails to all students, we loop through the array and use the object's properties. Combining arrays and objects makes our program dynamic.

Functions
Functions are like loops for reusing code. Functions allow us to reuse code and control execution. Let's modify the previous example without using a function.

js
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
  console.log('Sending email to', allStudents[i].email);
}
The line inside the loop won't work elsewhere. Functions can be called anywhere. Let's write a function to send emails.

js
Copy code
allStudents.forEach((item) => console.log('Email ', item.email));
allStudents.forEach((item) =>
  console.log('Full Name ', item.firstName, item.secondName)
);
We use the built-in forEach function. Functions are reusable and callable from anywhere.

When to use functions vs. loops? Use functions for repetitive tasks across different places. Use loops for repetitive tasks in one place. This might be hard to grasp initially, but practice will make it clear.

Here's how to write a function:

js
Copy code
function nameOfFunction() {
  console.log('Hello', 'Elias');
}

nameOfFunction(); // Hello Elias
nameOfFunction(); // Hello Elias
nameOfFunction(); // Hello Elias
We call the function multiple times, getting the same output. To make it dynamic, add a parameter.

js
Copy code
function nameOfFunction(name) {
  console.log('Hello', name);
}

nameOfFunction('Murshed'); // Hello Murshed
nameOfFunction('Fahim'); // Hello Fahim
nameOfFunction(); // Hello undefined
If no name is provided, it shows undefined. We can handle this error.

js
Copy code
function nameOfFunction(name) {
  if (!name) {
    console.log('Please provide your name');
  } else {
    console.log('Hello', name);
  }
}

nameOfFunction('Murshed'); // Hello Murshed
nameOfFunction('Fahim'); // Hello Fahim
nameOfFunction(); // Please provide your name
This example should be clear. Let's see another example of why functions are useful. We want to generate a random number between 1 and 10.

js
Copy code
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
For 1 to 100:

js
Copy code
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
For 1 to 1000:

js
Copy code
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
Instead of writing it multiple times, we create a function.

js
Copy code
function generateRandomNumber(max) {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
  return randomNumber;
}

console.log(generateRandomNumber(10));
console.log(generateRandomNumber(100));
console.log(generateRandomNumber(1000));
We can generate random numbers as needed. To generate a random number between two values:

js
Copy code
function generateRandomNumber(min, max) {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * min + (max - min));
  return randomNumber;
}

console.log(generateRandomNumber(5, 10));
console.log(generateRandomNumber(85, 100));
Functions simplify tasks and make code reusable.

Expression vs. Statement
Let's look at some examples before explaining.

js
Copy code
const name1 = 'Rayhan'; // Statement
const name2 = 'Alvi'; // Statement
const name3 = 'Anik'; // Statement
const name4 = 'Arjun'; // Statement
const name5 = 'Ayman'; // Statement

const students = [
  'Rayhan',
  'Alvi',
  'Anik',
  'Arjun',
  'Ayman',
  'Ayuub',
  'Bidyut',
]; // Statement

console.log(students[0]); // Expression
console.log(students[1]); // Expression
console.log(students[2]); // Expression
console.log(students[3]); // Expression
console.log(students[4]); // Expression

for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  console.log(students[i], students[i].toLowerCase()); // Expression
} // Statement

name1.sendEmail(); // Expression
name2.sendEmail(); // Expression
name3.sendEmail(); // Expression
name4.sendEmail(); // Expression
name5.sendEmail(); // Expression

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // Statement
const bools = [true, true, false, false]; // Statement
const nulls = [null, null, null]; // Statement
const undefineds = [undefined, undefined, undefined]; // Statement
const arrayOfArray = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
]; // Statement
const mixed = [true, null, 'Str', 5, [12, 2, 4]]; // Statement

const student1 = {
  firstName: 'Abu',
  secondName: 'Rayhan',
  email: 'rayhan@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
}; // Statement

const student2 = {
  firstName: 'Alvi',
  secondName: 'Chowdhury',
  email: 'alvi@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
}; // Statement

const student3 = {
  firstName: 'Akib',
  secondName: 'Ahmad',
  email: 'akib@example.com',
  age: 25,
  attend: true,
}; // Statement

const allStudents = [student1, student2, student3]; // Statement

for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
  sendMail(allStudents[i].email); // Expression
} // Statement

function sendMail(email) {
  console.log('Sending email to', email);
} // Statement

allStudents.forEach((item) => console.log('Email ', item.email)); // Expression
allStudents.forEach((item) =>
  console.log('Full Name ', item.firstName, item.secondName)
); // Expression

function nameOfFunction(name) {
  if (!name) {
    console.log('Please provide your name');
  } else {
    console.log('Hello', name);
  }
} // Statement

nameOfFunction('Murshed'); // Expression
nameOfFunction('Fahim'); // Expression
nameOfFunction(); // Expression

function generateRandomNumber(min = 1, max) {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * min + (max - min)); // Statement
  return randomNumber; // Expression
} // Statement

console.log(generateRandomNumber(5, 10)); // Expression
The basic difference between expressions and statements is that expressions always produce a value and can be stored somewhere. For instance, a function call is an expression. Statements, on the other hand, don't produce values, can't be stored, and don't return anything. Writing a function is a statement, and calling a function is an expression. When you write a function, it doesn't return anything until called. An arrow function is an expression because it is stored in a variable.

When to Use Arrays vs. Objects
Use objects for singular terms and arrays for plural terms. For example, a phone is an object, multiple phones are an array. A person is an object, people are an array. A member is an object, members are an array. When you need to store information about one entity, use an object. When you have multiple entities, use an array. Keep this in mind to avoid confusion.
