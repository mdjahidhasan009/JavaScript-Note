  What components does a programming language have? If we ask this question and list all the answers, it will be endless. In that case, if we can categorize each thing, it will be easier to create a roadmap for us. **There are mainly 3 core components of a programming language**. Core components mean without which a programming language cannot be imagined. These three components are:


  1. **Input:** There are many ways to provide input. **Typing** something on the **keyboard** is input, **submitting a form** is input, **searching something** on the browser is input. A programming language can have countless inputs. But when we start learning a language, we need to choose the standard input. This means our terminal will be open, and we will provide input using the keyboard. This is called standard input.

  2. **Processing:** After providing input, it will be processed somehow. This task is huge. This processing can be divided into two categories:

   - **Foundational:** This category includes what is needed to solve the main problem of an application. Some important topics are:
     - **Variable:** One of the most important aspects of a programming language is the variable. We often ignore it, but it is very important to understand where to use a variable and where not to. Unnecessary variables can lead to memory leaks. So, this topic needs to be understood.
     - **Statement/Expression**
     - **Operator**
     - **Logic:** This includes logical operations or logic building like condition, loop, etc.
     - **Function:** This is an excellent component for code reuse. We will learn about this in detail.
     - **Array, Key-Value Pair Data Structure:** There are many types of data structures, but not all are needed to solve problems. However, there are two data structures that are essential for problem-solving. These two data structures are provided by default in every programming language. Others are complex and implemented as needed. One of these data structures is the array. The most ignored data structure. Many of us do not know that an array is a data structure. If you visit the link "Array Data Structure - GeeksForGeeks," you will see how many algorithms exist for an array. We need to know these. Another data structure is the key-value pair. Array and key-value pair complement each other. In arrays, we cannot name the data; we have to work with indexes. But in a key-value pair, we can name the data. In JavaScript, it is called an object, in C it is called a structure, in Python it is called a dictionary, in Dart it is called a map, and in Java, it is a bit different since it is an object-oriented language, creating a class with two keys and values makes it a key-value pair. Among them, the most powerful is JavaScript's object. There are some differences in key-value pairs among all languages. But the main thing is, it will have a key and a value.

   The six components mentioned above are the puzzle pieces. All the small and large applications in the world have been created with these. The last one can be replaced with advanced data structures as needed. But the first five cannot be replaced.

   The child languages of C, such as C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, have very similar syntax. The foundational components differ only in syntax across languages, not in thought process. The thought process is the same. Only the syntax is different.

   - **Structural:** Maintaining code year after year is harder than writing code. If an application cannot be structured well, it becomes very difficult to maintain. We use this structural processing to solve the structural problem. It includes:
     - **OOP:** This is not language-specific. We discussed it in detail in the last class. It is a theorem. Although C is not an object-oriented programming language, we can apply OOP theory in C to perform OOP tasks. So, it appears that we can use OOP in languages that support OOP, and also in those that do not.
     - **Functional:** This is also not language-specific. Because it is a theorem. By using this, we can use a function as a value and build everything in the world with functions. Here too, we can use functional programming in languages that support it, and also in those that do not.
     - **Design Pattern:** This is not dependent on any programming language. Since OOP is not dependent on programming languages, we create design patterns using OOP in various ways. So, this is also not dependent on any programming language.
     - **Design Principles:** This is also not dependent on any programming language. It includes SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency inversion), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It), SoC (Separation of Concerns), Avoid Premature Optimization, Law of Demeter, Clean Code Architecture. Knowing these 7/8 principles roughly allows us to do anything. To get an idea of these topics, you can visit this link.
     - **DSA:** Here comes a question, which language is better to learn DSA? We actually do not understand what DSA is? DSA is a type of mathematics. There is a branch of mathematics called discrete mathematics. Data Structure and Algorithm belong to this branch. DSA existed long before programming languages. It can be applied using any language. Data structure is about structuring my data in a way that I can easily insert, retrieve, update, and delete data. Now, we will select the data structure according to the task we will perform. But one thing to keep in mind is that DSA has no relation with programming languages.

     However, the main problem of the application cannot be solved by structural processing. For that, some topics are needed, which are discussed in the foundational processing.

     Among the two components above, the most important is the foundational component. All the problems in the world have been solved with this. Structural is needed for development purposes. Until we are comfortable with the foundational, we should not move to structural. We will work with the foundational in an imperative way.

  3. **Output:** After processing, we will have an output. The output can be a monitor, JavaScript DOM, printer, soundbox, etc. But when we first learn a programming language, we will work with the standard output. Later, we will learn the others while working.

### Why JavaScript is Called a Weird Language

JavaScript is called such because it has OOP and functional aspects in a way that confuses beginners. Just as OOP tasks can be done here, when writing methods, we can use all aspects of functions. This needs to be clarified very well. Another problem is that **JavaScript is a dynamically and weakly typed language**. **JavaScript tries to convert one data type to another, which is a problem**. For example:

```javascript
let a = 'ab';
console.log(Number(a)); // NaN
```

If this was in Python, it would give an error. But JavaScript tries to convert it and outputs NaN. These are the reasons JavaScript is called a weird language.

  <summary>Why We Use Functions</summary>

  Suppose we have a requirement to add two numbers. There will be a total of six calculations of this addition. We start writing it in an imperative way.

```javascript
let a = 10 + 20;
let b = 20 + 30;
let c = 40 + 50;
let d = 10 + 20;
let e = 20 + 30;
let f = 40 + 50;
```
Then suddenly the client comes and says, "The addition you mentioned should not be addition, it should be subtraction." You again sit and change everything like this:

```javascript
let a = 10 - 20;
let b = 20 - 30;
let c = 40 - 50;
let d = 10 - 20;
let e = 20 - 30;
let f = 40 - 50;
```

Now again the client comes and says, "I made a mistake, it should be addition but subtract 1 from each." Your head is on fire. But you have no choice but to change it again like this:

```javascript
let a = 10 + 20 - 1;
let b = 20 + 30 - 1;
let c = 40 + 50 - 1;
let d = 10 + 20 - 1;
let e = 20 + 30 - 1;
let f = 40 + 50 - 1;
```
Now you think the client is not convenient. He comes at different times and gives different changes. If there are six thousand instead of six, it would be crazy. So, you smartly create a function like this:

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b - 1;
}
```

And write the variables like this:

```javascript
let a = myFunction(10, 20);
let b = myFunction(20, 30);
let c = myFunction(40, 50);
let d = myFunction(10, 20);
let e = myFunction(20, 30);
let f = myFunction(40, 50);
```

Now if the client comes and says, "Subtract 1," you only change one place. That is, remove -1 from the function. The function becomes like this:

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
Then if he says, "I actually want the sum of the squares of each number," no problem. Change the function body:

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a ** a + b ** b;
}
```

So, we see that using functions reduces our work, makes debugging easier, makes code maintenance easier, and we can reuse the code. Whenever we see that some code needs to be written twice, we use functions. Wherever there is code repetition, we use functions.

</br>
As beginners, we mainly face problems in two places. One is declaring variables, and the other is declaring functions. The solution is:

Whenever we have data, we will create a variable for that data.
First, we will continue with the work we have. As we continue, if we see that we have done the same work more than once, we will write a function for it. Here we have unknowingly applied a design principle, which is DRY.
Final Words
If we consider the structural component as the design and color of a building, then the foundational component is the brick, sand, cement, rod. No matter how beautiful your building is, if the brick, sand, cement, rod are not good, the building will not last. So, we should clear the foundational first and then move to the structural. There should be no lack in the foundational.
