# Nodejs
Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network
applications. It is characterized by:

## Event-Based
Handles operations through events, enabling asynchronous programming.
## Non-Blocking
Uses non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations to ensure high performance.
## Google's V8 JavaScript Engine
Executes JavaScript code efficiently. V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome 
browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and
runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. Note: It can
run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
## libuv Library
Provides support for asynchronous I/O operations.
