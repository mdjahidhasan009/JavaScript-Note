ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA 
International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was 
released in 1997.


JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed 
under the name Mocha, but later the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of
Netscape.

### JavaScript interpreted language
JavaScript is traditionally considered an interpreted language, but modern execution involves a mix of interpretation 
and compilation.
#### Interpreted Language
In the traditional sense, JavaScript is interpreted. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, 
interprets each line, and runs it.
#### Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation
Nowadays, modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. This means that the JavaScript 
engine compiles the JavaScript code to executable bytecode just as it is about to run, which combines aspects of both
interpretation and compilation.

### JavaScript Case Sensitive
Language keywords, variables, function names, object names, and other identifiers must always be typed with consistent
capitalization.
```js
let name = "John";
let Name = "Doe";

console.log(name); // Outputs: John
console.log(Name); // Outputs: Doe
```
