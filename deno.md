# Deno
Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust
programming language. It solves the inherent problems of Node.Js and has been officially released in May 2018. Unlike
Node.JS, by default Deno executes the code in a sandbox, which means that runtime has no access to below areas:

* The file system
* The network
* Execution of other scripts
* The environment variables
