# Debouncing
Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid
unnecessary CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance. The debounce function make sure that your code is only
triggered once per user input. 

The common use cases are 
* search box suggestions, 
* text-field auto-saves
* eliminating double-button clicks etc.

Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you
write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out
using clearTimeout and reschedule API call/DB query for a new timeâ€”300 ms in the future.
```js
function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, timeout);
  };
}
function fetchResults() {
  console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
}
const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
```
The debounce() function can be used on input, button and window events

**Input**
```js
<input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
```

**Button**
```js
<button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
```

**Windows Event**
```js
window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
```
